# Hello! I'm Jason Rai
These days I am working mostly with Flutter and Dart. Hoping to help the community thrive by putting out some libraries and contributing where I can.

I'm active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JimsonRai) occasionally post some videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTP5AUrI8DeHcrRDtINTDqg).
